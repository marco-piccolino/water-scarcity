    "## Research questions\n",
    "1. How are **small-scale farmers** tackling the issue of **water scarcity**?\n",
    "2. Can solutions involving **ICT help mitigate** the **causes**, or the **effects**, of water scarcity?\n",
    "3. Can solutions involving **ICT interact** and **co-exist** with solutions involving use of **traditional knowledge and techniques**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regional and social focus** of the research will be narrowed down after a first survey of available **resources and opportunities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activities\n",
    "- carry out a **survey** of **available resources and opportunities**\n",
    "- elaborate a detailed **research proposal**, outlining specific **goals and methods**\n",
    "- undertake all required **steps to give an adequate answer** to the three main research questions\n",
    "- **interact with tutors, mentors and other stakeholders** on a regular basis, to **gain insights and share interim results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **expected outcome** is a **report** that can be leveraged for different purposes, including **mapping innovators** who are active in the field of water scarcity mitigation and **highlighting relevant ICT technologies**."

    "### Water scarcity\n",
    "\n",
    "According to UN Water,\n",
    "> Water scarcity can mean scarcity in availability due to physical shortage, or scarcity in access due to the failure of institutions to ensure a regular supply or due to a lack of adequate infrastructure.\n",
    "[Retrieved 31/8/2022](https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity)\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition highlights multiple sources for this condition: the **environmental**, the **socio-political**, the **infrastructural**.\n",
    "Hence, for the contexts that we analyse, we will try to understand which of these elements is the **prevailing** one (as the distinction, in most cases, won't be clear-cut). Yet, given the limited scope of this research, pinpointing the **deep causes** of the phenomenon, in a _systems thinking_ fashion (see e.g. [Introduction to Systems Thinking - Retrieved 31/8/2022](https://thesystemsthinker.com/introduction-to-systems-thinking/)), will not be practically attainable."

    "### Small-scale farmers\n",
    "\n",
    "UN's LEO Thesaurus defines _small-scale farming_ as something that can be _variably_ defined, e.g.\n",
    "> farms “with a low asset base and operating in less than 2 hectares of cropland” (World Bank Rural Development Strategy, 2003);  \n",
    "> operating under structural constraints such as access to sub-optimal amounts of resources, technology and markets;  \n",
    "> limited resource endowment compared to those of other farmers in the sector (Dixon et al., 2004);  \n",
    "> struggle to be competitive (…) (Brooks et al., 2009)  \n",
    "[Retrieved 31/8/2022](https://leap.unep.org/knowledge/glossary/small-scale-farming)\n",
    "\n",
    "These definitions go beyond the intuitive association between \"small-scale\" and **farm size or extension**, including instead also **assets, resources, technology, markets, competitiveness**.  \n",
    "Indeed, \"limited resource endowment compared to those of other farmers in the sector\" seems to provide a still vague, but at least _relative_ definition, rather than a less useful absolute one. A relative definition requires taking into account the operating environment in which a group of people devote themselves to farming.\n",
