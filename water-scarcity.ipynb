    "## Research questions\n",
    "1. How are **small farmers** tackling the issue of **water scarcity**?\n",
    "2. Can solutions involving **ICT help mitigate** the **causes**, or the **effects**, of water scarcity?\n",
    "3. Can solutions involving **ICT interact** and **co-exist** with solutions involving use of **traditional knowledge and techniques**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regional and social focus** of the research will be narrowed down after a first survey of available **resources and opportunities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activities\n",
    "- carry out a **survey** of **available resources and opportunities**\n",
    "- elaborate a detailed **research proposal**, outlining specific **goals and methods**\n",
    "- undertake all required **steps to give an adequate answer** to the three main research questions\n",
    "- **interact with tutors, mentors and other stakeholders** on a regular basis, to **gain insights and share interim results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **expected outcome** is a **report** that can be leveraged for different purposes, including **mapping innovators** who are active in the field of water scarcity mitigation and **highlighting relevant ICT technologies**."
